# http2-tests

A simple test for a reverse proxy http/1.1 to http/2 with nodejs.

## Setup

At the moment you will need a SSL certificate (self-signed) within a subfolder called */ssl* and an application to proxy which needs to at "localhost:8080". For more info checkout *index.js*.

## Run it

*npm run start*
